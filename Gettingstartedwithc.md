So, i had installed ubuntu a few months back. 
Now that i am learning C language, i wanted to make sure the right packages are installed in linux for C language so that i can practice better. 
So i typed `sudo apt-get update` on my command prompt to install packages that were missing. 
Once that was done, `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to install additional packages and to upgrade a few old ones. 
gcc -v and g++ -v, gcc: GNU Cross Compiler, g++ GNU C++ Compiler. GNU: GNU's not UNIX. We got to know that these compilers were already built in.
